Jobs that are routine and repetitive are likely to be replaced by robots, while jobs that require creativity, complex problem solving and human interaction will remain relevant.

2. Transport: Advances in autonomous vehicles and intelligent traffic management can transform the transportation industry. Human drivers might be replaced by vehicles controlled by artificial intelligence, and transportation systems could be optimized with big data analysis to reduce congestion and increase efficiency.

3. Healthcare: Big data and artificial intelligence can have a huge impact on healthcare. Big health data analysis can help in early diagnosis, drug research, and more effective treatment. Robotics can also be used in precision surgical procedures and real-time patient monitoring.

4. Education: The use of technologies such as artificial intelligence and big data can change education in significant ways. Adaptive learning systems can be adapted to the individual needs of students, and the data collected can provide insight into student performance and assist in the development of more effective curricula.

5. Finance and Banking: In the financial industry, big data can be used for risk analysis, increased security, and the provision of more personalized financial services. Robotics and artificial intelligence can also be used in the process of automating routine tasks such as processing insurance claims or managing investment portfolios.
