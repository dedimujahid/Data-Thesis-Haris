"Society 5.0 is a concept developed by the Japanese government as a vision for a future society. It describes an era in which information technology, big data, robotics, and artificial intelligence (AI) play a role in advancing society and human life.

This approach has interesting potential. The use of big data can provide a better understanding of people's needs and preferences, thereby enabling governments and organizations to make better decisions and provide more effective services. For example, by collecting and analyzing health data, governments can identify health trends and better direct resources to address diseases or outbreaks.

Robotics and artificial intelligence can also contribute to increasing productivity and efficiency in various sectors, such as industry, transportation or health services. Robots and AI can perform repetitive tasks with great precision and speed, allowing humans to focus on jobs requiring specialized skills or human interaction.

However, there are several considerations that need to be considered in implementing Society 5.0. First, it is important to ensure that these technologies are applied wisely and within the proper regulatory framework. This is to avoid negative impacts, such as loss of human work or privacy issues involving widespread use of data.

In addition, keep in mind that not everyone has the same access or ability to adopt and utilize this technology. In realizing Society 5.0, attention must be paid to the digital divide, so that there is no further social separation between those who are able to keep up with technological developments and those who are left behind.

Overall, Society 5.0 offers the potential to improve human life and society as a whole through the use of big data, robotics and artificial intelligence. However, its implementation must be carried out carefully, taking into account ethical, regulatory and social inclusion aspects to ensure maximum benefit for the entire population.",0.9919,Positif

Deep Learning
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science devoted to solving cognitive problems commonly associated with human intelligence, such as learning, problem solving and pattern recognition. Artificial Intelligence, often abbreviated as ""AI"", may connote robotics or futuristic scenes, Artificial Intelligence (AI) surpasses science fiction robots, into modern advanced computer science non-fiction. Professor Pedro Domingos, a leading researcher in this field, describes the ""five tribes"" of machine learning, consisting of symbolic, derived from logic and philosophy; connectionists, who have their origins in neuroscience; evolutionary, relating to evolutionary biology; Bayesian, related to statistics and probability; and analogies derived from psychology. More recently, advances in statistical computational efficiency have made Bayesian successful in advancing the field in a number of areas, called ""machine learning"". Likewise, advances in network computing have led connectionists to expand into a subfield called ""deep learning"". Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) are fields of computer science that stem from the discipline of Artificial Intelligence.",0.9839,Positif
